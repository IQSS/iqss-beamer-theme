# What is it?
A [Beamer](https://github.com/josephwright/beamer) theme.

# Requirements
This theme uses [fontspec](https://github.com/wspr/fontspec/) and
expects that you will typeset your slides using
[XeTeX](http://xetex.sourceforge.net/). You must also install the
[Libertinus fonts](https://github.com/khaledhosny/libertinus).

# Installation
Clone this repository and move the `.sty` files to your `TEXMFHOME`
directory. If you don't know where to put personal style files check
your LaTeX distribution documentation, or run `kpsewhich -var-value
TEXMFHOME` in a terminal.

# Use
Just put `\usetheme{iqss}` in the preamble.
